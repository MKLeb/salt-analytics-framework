Several improvements to the project

* The `salt-analytics.examples` package now uses the same version as `salt-analytics-framework`
* Defer imports of uncommon usage libraries to reduce base requirements(for example, keras, numpy, papermill)
* When loading plugin configs, catch `KeyError` on unavailable plugins and list all available.
* Pass the event tag and stamp explicitly when calling `saf.utils.eventbus._construct_event()`
